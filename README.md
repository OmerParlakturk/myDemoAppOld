The Program takes 3 integer arrays in the first, second and third box; the last (the fourth) box takes an integer to check equality to sum of all integers in the first, second and third box. If the given integer (in the fourth box) is equal to sum of all integers in arrays, the program shows the result as "... = ..." ; otherwise, if it is not equal then the program shows the result as "... != ..."
